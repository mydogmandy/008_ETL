# Movies-ETL
Bootcamp Module 8


This module dealt with extracting transforming, and loading data from 3 different sources relating to movies for the company Amazing Prime.

Assumptions about the data:

1. The data is current.  Since we are not pulling data from an api that might be updated at a faster rate, we do not know at what frequency the data is refreshed.
2. We assume all future data from these sources will not have any formatting issues we already encountered with this dataset.
3. The reasonable amount of records is an educated guess, based off how many films may be made in a given time frame.
4. The data is assumed to be good data and not corrupted before import
5. We are assuming the wikipedia data is accurate when it comes to specific information such as box office & complete information
6. We assume any movie containing data in "No. of episodes" is a TV show
7. We assume the different languages columns all contain alternate titles
8. We assume the small amount of data we cannot change will not make a difference in the final outcome
